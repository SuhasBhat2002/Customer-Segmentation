# Customer-Segmentation
Customer Segmentation using K-Means clustering on an e-commerce dataset with more than 100k customer data.
All Analyses and thought processes are in the project markdown.

Here’s a quick breakdown of my process:
 🔹 Merged multiple datasets to create a unified view
 🔹 Performed exploratory data analysis
 🔹 Applied StandardScaler and OneHotEncoding for preprocessing
 🔹 Used PCA for dimensionality reduction
 🔹 Implemented K-Means Clustering to identify customer segments
 🔹 Determined the optimal number of clusters using Silhouette Score
 🔹 Analyzed the resulting clusters and identified key characteristics
 🔹 Assigned intuitive labels to each customer group

💡 Biggest takeaway?
 Success in clustering doesn't just depend on running K-Means—
 ✔️ Proper data preparation,
 ✔️ Correct encoding and dimensionality reduction, and
 ✔️ Choosing the right number of clusters
...are all critical to getting meaningful results.

But the most crucial step? Interpreting the clusters.
 Execution is only half the job—the other half is making sense of the output, visualizing, and translating clusters into actionable insights.
This project really underscored the value of thoughtful data prep and interpretation in unsupervised learning.
